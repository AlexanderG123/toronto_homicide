write a data simulation in R from the beginning of 2004 until the end of 2020 where there is a column with each date from 2004 until 2020

where there is a runif 20% chance of the event happening everyday and it can happen more than once a day

filter so that only the days that the event occurs are shown in the data

there should also be a column randomly selecting numbers from 1 to 158 with equal probability on those days

there should also be a column randomly selecting between "shooting", "stabbing" or "other" with equal probability for each event 
a column with the day of the week each day the event occurs

and a an additional column with only the year of the event

To create this data simulation in R, you will need to use several functions and packages. We will generate a sequence of dates from the beginning of 2004 until the end of 2020. For each date, we will simulate the occurrence of an event with a 20% chance and, if the event occurs, we will assign a random number between 1 and 158 and randomly select a type of event (shooting, stabbing, or other).  We will then add a column with the day of the week and a column with the year. Finally we will filter the data to only show days where the event occurs.  Here's how you can do it:

library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

# Create a sequence of dates from 2004-01-01 to 2020-12-31
dates <- seq(from = ymd("2004-01-01"), to = ymd("2020-12-31"), by = "day")

# Initialize an empty data frame
simulated_data <- data.frame(Date = dates)

# Simulate the event occurrence
set.seed(123) # Setting a seed for reproducibility
simulated_data <- simulated_data %>% 
  mutate(EventOccurs = runif(n()) < 0.2, # 20% chance of event
         RandomNumber = ifelse(EventOccurs, sample(1:158, size = n(), replace = TRUE), NA),
         EventType = ifelse(EventOccurs, sample(c("shooting", "stabbing", "other"), size = n(), replace = TRUE), NA),
         DayOfWeek = ifelse(EventOccurs, format(Date, "%a"), NA), # Add abbreviated day of the week using format()
         Year = ifelse(EventOccurs, year(Date), NA) # Add year
  ) %>%
  filter(EventOccurs) # Keep only the rows where the event occurs

# View the data
head(simulated_data)
