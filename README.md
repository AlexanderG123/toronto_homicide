## Overview of the Project

This repo documents the steps and processes used in creating the paper "Exploring Homicide Trends in Toronto: A Seventeen-Year Statistical Overview (2004-2020)". 

Use this folder to reproduce the results on your own.

Note on LLM usage: 
LLMs were used sparingly, GPT 3.5 was somewhat helpful with simulating my dataset but I found it more frustrating than it was worth because it spat out code that I didn't understand that I needed to edit to get what I actually wanted.  

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `input/data` contains the data sources used in analysis including the raw data.
-   `outputs/data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `outputs/paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.
